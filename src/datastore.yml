# for each signal from DBC file or self generated data its necessary to define a Store here with the keys:
#   _Common keys and values_
#   FORMAT:
#       MULTI_CSV:
#           csv-file with all declared values in one file
#           file name: <StoreName>-<date>__<time>
#       SINGLE_CSV:
#           cvs-file(s), each for every declared value
#           file name: <StoreName>_<ShelfName>_<STORE_MODE>-<date>__<time>
#   MERGE:
#       Datastores with "MERGE" are virtual Stores. 
#       They dont receive Data from anywhere, they fetch data from sources in the list below "MERGE"
#           syntax: [operation, DataShelf in this Store, Store to merge with, Shelf in that Store, DataBox in that Shelf]
#           operation can be:
#           "get": get value from elsewhere and put it into thes shelf
#           "and": get bool values from the list of variables, do "and"-function and put in the shelf
#           "or": get bool values from the list of variables, do "or"-function and put in the shelf
#           "add": get values from the list of variables, do "add"-function and put in the shelf
#       !!! They have no associated real sending device !!!
#       !!! consider they must be build _after all other_ (real) stores are build !!!
#
#   RRD_DB:
#       definition of a RRD-Database
#       Syntax: [store, shelf, Data]
#           store:  "SELF" - reference to this store
#                   §<Storename> - reference to "Storename", can be any other definded store
#                   reserved Storenames:
#                       "OUTFILE" - filename of the RRD-file, this must be the first line
#                       "INFILE"  - filename to read data from
#           shelf:  §<Shelfname> - shelfname in the referenced store
#                   "CONST" - dont read from a shelf, use the constant value
#           Data:   any Databox-value-Name to read from
#                   or the constant value if shelf = CONST
#
#   FILLED_UP:  
#       a Flag, if defined MULTICSV-files have no empty columns (like ",,"). These gap(s) are filled with the latest known value(s)
#       otherwise (if not defined) there are gap(s) if no current value is available
#   RELOAD_TIMEOUT:
#       the reload count value to to check if the Store is still alive 
#       can be omitted
#   TIMEOUT:
#       the current timeout value. 
#
#   _keys and values for each DataShelf
#   RELOAD_CNT:
#       the reload count value for STORE_MODE = COUNT and STORE_MODE = AVR
#       can be omitted for other STORE_MODEs
#   CNT:
#       the current count value. 
#   STORE_MODES: 
#      NONE: 
#         dont care for this signal
#      CHANGE:
#           only value changes are stored, just to save space 
#      COUNT:
#          count RELOAD_CNT values and than store one, just to save space
#      AVR:
#          average calculation with RELOAD_CNT values
#      ALL:
#           saving everything
#   MIN:
#       Min value for this signal, if not used set it i.e. to 0 or any other numeric value
#   MAX:
#       Max value for this signal, if not used set it i.e. to 0 or any other numeric value
#   CURRENT_IN_RANGE:
#       the signal is within MIN and MAX
#       MIN, MAX and IN_RANGE can be omitted if not used
#   AVR_IN_RANGE:
#       same as CURRENT_IN_RANGE but checked against the AVR value(s)
#   DECIMALS:
#       number of digits after comma (for float)
#
#   structure of a Storedefinition:
#   <StoreName>: (with the following StoreShelf")
#           Commons:
#               keys and values as descirbed above
#           <shelf_1>:
#               keys and values as descirbed above
#           <shelf_2>:
#               keys and values as descirbed above
#           <shelf_3>:
#               keys and values as descirbed above
#           ...
#   "Commons" is a ShelfName wich every Store must have.
