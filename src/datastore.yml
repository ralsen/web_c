# for each signal from DBC file or self generated data its necessary to define a Store here with the keys:
#   _Common keys and values_
#   FORMAT:
#       MULTI_CSV:
#           csv-file with all declared values in one file
#           file name: <StoreName>-<date>__<time>
#       SINGLE_CSV:
#           cvs-file(s), each for every declared value
#           file name: <StoreName>_<ShelfName>_<STORE_MODE>-<date>__<time>
#   MERGE:
#       Datastores with "MERGE" are virtual Stores. 
#       They dont receive Data from nowhere, they fetch data from sources in the list below "MERGE"
#       !!! They have no associated real sending device !!!
#   FILLED_UP:  
#       a Flag, if defined MULTICSV-files have no empty columns (like ",,"). These gap(s) are filled with the latest known value(s)
#       otherwise (if not defined) there are gap(s) if no current value is available
#   RELOAD_TIMEOUT:
#       the reload count value to to check if the Store is still alive 
#       can be omitted
#   TIMEOUT:
#       the current timeout value. 
#
#   _keys and values for each DataShelf
#   RELOAD_CNT:
#       the reload count value for STORE_MODE = COUNT and STORE_MODE = AVR
#       can be omitted for other STORE_MODEs
#   CNT:
#       the current count value. 
#   STORE_MODES: 
#      NONE: 
#         dont care for this signal
#      CHANGE:
#           only value changes are stored, just to save space 
#      COUNT:
#          count RELOAD_CNT values and than store one, just to save space
#      AVR:
#          average calculation with RELOAD_CNT values
#      ALL:
#           saving everything
#   MIN:
#       Min value for this signal, if not used set it i.e. to 0 or any other numeric value
#   MAX:
#       Max value for this signal, if not used set it i.e. to 0 or any other numeric value
#   CURRENT_IN_RANGE:
#       the signal is within MIN and MAX
#       MIN, MAX and IN_RANGE can be omitted if not used
#   AVR_IN_RANGE:
#       same as CURRENT_IN_RANGE but checked against the AVR value(s)
#   DECIMALS:
#       number of digits after comma (for float)
#
#   structure of a Storedefinition:
#   <StoreName>: (with the following StoreShelf")
#           Commons:
#               keys and values as descirbed above
#           <shelf_1>:
#               keys and values as descirbed above
#           <shelf_2>:
#               keys and values as descirbed above
#           <shelf_3>:
#               keys and values as descirbed above
#           ...
#   "Commons" is a ShelfName wich every Store must have.
